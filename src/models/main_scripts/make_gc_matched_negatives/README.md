Execute the **run.sh** file to generate inputsu for SVM model training. 

That file is a wrapper for the following steps: 

task=$1  # Name of the task being performed, generated by the user.   
idr=$2  # NarrowPeak file with IDR peak calls. 
fasta=$3 # fasta file for your organism, i.e. /mnt/data/mm10_no_alt_analysis_set_ENCODE.fasta
chrom_sizes=$4 #chrom sizes file for your organism, i.e. /mnt/data/annotations/by_release/mm10/mm10.chrom.sizes
genomewide_gc_prefix=$5 #you pick this, example genomewide gc files are in /mnt/data/annotations/gc_content_tracks/non_smoothed/


echo "starting $task $idr"   
./get_svm_peak_splits.sh $task $idr  
echo "got svm peak splits"   

./get_gc_positives.sh $task   
echo "got gc content of the positive sequences"   

#You want to have gc content bins for your genome of interest for the next step. For human, these can be found in the lab cluster:
#/mnt/data/annotations/gc_content_tracks/non_smoothed
#you can also generate them with this script:
./get_genomewide_gc_bins.sh $fasta $chrom_sizes $genomewide_gc_prefix

./get_all_negatives.sh $task $idr  $genomewide_gc_prefix.tsv
echo "got candidate negative set"   

./get_chrom_gc_region_dict.sh $task  
echo "created python pickle for candidate negatives"   

./form_svm_input_fastas.sh $task  
echo "finished creating SVM inputs"
